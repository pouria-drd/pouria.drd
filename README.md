# üåê Pouria Darandi - Personal Portfolio

This is my **personal portfolio website**, built with **Next.js** v-15 to showcase my **projects, skills, and experience** in web development. Designed for **performance, SEO, and responsiveness**, it serves as a central hub for my work and professional presence.

### üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pouria-drd/pouria.drd.git

    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

```env
# Set the base path for the application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=""
